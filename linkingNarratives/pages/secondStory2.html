<p class="topText"> I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. 
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p>

<p>I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting <a href="secondStory3.html">fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.</p>

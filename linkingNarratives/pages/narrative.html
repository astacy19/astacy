	<h2> Stanford Universtiy 2005</h2>
	<p>	<span class="firstWords">I am honored</span> to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to  tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

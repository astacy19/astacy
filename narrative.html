	<p>I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
	<p><a href="link">The first story is about connecting the dots. </p>
	<p><a href="link">My second story is about love and loss. </p>

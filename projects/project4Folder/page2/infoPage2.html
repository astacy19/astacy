		<p>Heavier Things is the second studio album by American recording artist John Mayer, released on September 9, 2003 by Aware and Columbia Records.</p>

		<p>The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 317,000 copies in its first week of sales.[3] Despite some criticism towards Mayer's songwriting, Heavier Things received generally positive reviews from critics.</p>
		<p>Mayer felt he could be more relaxed and focus more on his art while making Heavier Things. With Jack Joseph Puig as producer, loops and horns were more prominently featured. Mayer took greater control of the creative side with this album; much of the album was recorded in his New York City apartment. He also got final approval on all radio-edits. Mayer explained that he did not want a "big and bold" title for the record and expressed that the name Heavier Things is "what it is" due to its "insignificance". He further said that he likes the word "things" due to finding it "nondescript and dumb, [...] kind of blunt".</p>

		<p>Columbia Records used a conservative marketing campaign to promote the album. Columbia Records Group president Will Botwin says. "We think we're being smart. It's a long-term project. We understand what we're creating is a career. Effectively, that's the message: Keep the hype at bay."[4] In keeping with that gameplan, the album's first single, "Bigger Than My Body", only went to radio a few weeks before the album's release; promotional broadcasts of the album were limited to MTV.com and Mayer's official site, both of whom began streaming the complete album the September 2 before its release. Scheduled television appearances included Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4 and several late shows. Columbia Records thought it was important to put Mayer in talk show-type scenarios before the album release to help bring focus to his art and to his singer/songwriter career; to steer away from the fame and celebrity hype.</p>

				<p><span class="firstWords">Paradise Valley</span> is the sixth studio album by American recording artist John Mayer, released on August 20, 2013 by Columbia Records. Musically, it is similar to his previous album Born and Raised (2012), but also features more musical breaks and instrumentals consisting of electric guitars rather than harmonica. Its title refers to Mayer's home along the Yellowstone River in Montana's Paradise Valley, where he has lived since 2012.</p>

				<p>The album's first single "Paper Doll" was released on June 18, 2013, followed by "Wildfire" on July 16, 2013, which officially impacted Triple A radio on August 20, 2013. "Who You Love" was released as the third single, impacting Hot AC radio on September 3, 2013.</p>

				<p>The Search for Everything is the seventh studio album by American recording artist John Mayer, released on April 14, 2017 by Columbia Records.</p>
				
				<p>The Search for Everything received moderately positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 61, which indicates "generally favorable reviews" based on 4 reviews.</p>

				<p>Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars, commenting "Although it's ostensibly a breakup album, The Search for Everything doesn't feel haunted: Mayer glides through the record so smoothly, the supple sound seems almost insouciant. It is also quite alluring. "[12] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly called it "the most deeply personal album Mayer has ever released", giving it B+ while stating "if mellowness remains Mayer’s weakness, the brilliance of his best compositions provides a worthy trade-off".[14] Robert Christgau gave this album a two-star honorable mention: "If you wonder why women fall for a guy with his romantic history, listen to his songs with an open mind", highlighting "Love on the Weekend" and "Never on the Day You Leave".</p>

				<p>However, Alex McLevy of AV Club gave the album a D, stating "John Mayer loses all trace of anything interesting".[13] The 4.9 out of 10 review from Katherine St. Asaph of Pitchfork was also unfavorable, saying the album is "pleasantly bland".</p>
